// You have a fashion catalog, an inventory of items from various high-fashion designers. 
// Each designer has a lineup of shoes. Each shoe has a name and a price.

// It looks like this:

// Concatenate all the information of each shoe: {designer name}, {shoe name}, {price} and separate each shoeâ€™s full info with a new line



function renderInventory(inventory) {
  // your code here
  // hint: before you just dive into coding...
  // it's a good idea to sketch out a skeleton like you've been seeing earlier in this module...
